# Radio-Apps
Repo for various Android-Radio-Apps from my favourite stations.

The main purpose for this apps is to allow streaming inside the Android-Ecosystem including Android WearOS and Automotive (Android Auto). There are no Metadata for particullar songs shown to keep a driver concentrated while driving. It's about to enjoy the music.

Both apps base on the UAMP-Project by the Android-Developers and got some polished UI-Designs.

Please take note that there are no official usage-approvals by the copyright-owners. Currently this is the MackNEXT GmbH und Co. KG in Rust / Germany and the Radio Regenbogen Channels in South-Germany.
